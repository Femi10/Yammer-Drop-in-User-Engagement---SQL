INVESTIGATION AND REPORT-ON-DROP-IN USER ENGAGEMENT

A short case study investigating a drop in user engagement featuring a faux dataset of Yammer's user database from Mode Analytics. https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement/

Yammer is a freemium enterprise social networking service used for private communication within organizations. Access to a Yammer network is determined by a user's internet domain so that only individuals with approved email addresses may join

The problem
You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user engagement dashboards. You fire them up, and something immediately jumps out:

 
Potential Causes
After putting the problem into context, a collection of possible problem was put together for evaluation 
1.	Holiday – Vacation could be a possible reason for the low usage of yammer, this would be accessed by checking if there are significant changes in the usage range across countries.

2.	Competition – It is also possible is that users of yammer has shifted their interest to other products that are similar to yammer, hence the low engagement.

3.	Marketing and content quality: A third possible reason for a dip in user’s engagement could be the quality of marketing activities and content on yammer itself.

Technical issue with website: I will also consider if this is anyhow related to issues with accessibility to the website.
